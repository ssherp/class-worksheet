## Mock Interview Phase 


1. You will be paired up with another student from class - 2 students "A Group + B Group"
2. Each pair will find a private breakout room to work within
3. You will then alternate being the interviewee and interviewer with your now mastered questions.

##### As an interviewee you should focus on:
* Clarity in your mental modeling of your approach
* Openness to feedback, hints, and suggestions
* Playfulness with the puzzle presented
* Engagement with your interviewer

##### As an interviewer you should focus on:
* Clearly articulating the prompt
* Seeking clarification not from what you understand the problem to be but how the interviewee is explaining it
* Providing suggestions and supportive guidance

##### Hold your interviewee to a high standard
> Did they follow the pattern:
  Q: What are you going to do?
  Q: How are you going to do it?
  Q: Why are you going to do it?
