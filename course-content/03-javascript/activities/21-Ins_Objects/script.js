// Objects are a collection of properties
//JavaScript objects are a lot like objects in real life. They are things that have distinct characteristics or properties. 
//For this first JavaScript object, the thing we will create is a planet.
//We use object literal notation to create the planet object, and we use curly brackets {} to hold the values, as follows:

var planet = {
  // Properties are made up of key-value pairs
  //We use key-value pairs to give the properties a name and a value, as shown in the following example:
  //Objects usually have many related properties that help to define the object, as shown in the following example:
  name: "Earth",
  age: "4.543 billion years",
  moons: 1,
  isPopulated: true,
  population: "7.594 billion",
  "is Nice": true
};



console.log(planet.population);
// console.log(planet["population"]);

// To access a property's value that is a string, number or booleean, use the object's name and the associated key	
// Uses dot notation and logs "Earth"
//To access the value stored in a property, we use dot notation, as follows:	
console.log(planet.name);
// console.log(planet["name"]);

// Uses bracket notation and logs "Earth"
//We can also use bracket notation to access a value. When we use bracket notation, the key goes in quotes, as shown in the following example:
console.log(planet["is Nice"]);
// planet["is Nice"] =  true;
// planet["is Nice"]
planet.isNice = true;

planet["isNice"] = false;
