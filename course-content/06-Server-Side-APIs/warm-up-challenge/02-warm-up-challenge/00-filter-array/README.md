# Morning Challenge

## Filter Array

* Write a function that takes in three arguments: a high value, a low value and an array of numbers. 

* The function should console.log a new array of numbers where none of the elements are less than the low value and none of the elements are greater than the high value


### Example

var down = 10;
var up = 20;
var arr = [2,5,99,15,23,18,11,21];

filterArray(up, down, arr); ==> returns [15, 18, 11]
