// The Document.location read-only property returns a Location object, which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL and loading another URL.

// Though Document.location is a read-only Location object, you can also assign a string to it. This means that you can work with document.location as if it were a string in most cases: document.location = 'http://www.example.com' is a synonym of document.location.href = 'http://www.example.com'. If you assign another string to it, browser will load the website you assigned.

// To retrieve just the URL as a string, the read-only document.URL property can also be used.
